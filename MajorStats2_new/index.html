						</blockquote>
					</aside>
					<p>The NFL has emerged into a pass-heavy game, much more so than the history of the league has ever seen.
						While passing records continue to fall with the incorporation of faster, spread offense, perhaps the run game is getting overlooked as the true key to success.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Seattle Seahawks are a prime example of this. The 2014 Seahawks burst into the playoff scene on the back of Pro Bowl running back Marshawn Lynch’s 1306 rush yards and star quarterback Russell Wilson’s ability to scramble for nearly 900 yards.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite pundits and players’ declarations that year that the NFL “is a passing league now”, the Seahawks’ rushing power led them all the way to a second consecutive Super Bowl appearance that year.

					<p>In Superbowl 49, Malcolm Butler iconically picked up Russell WIlson on the goal line
						to seal the Patriots’ 24-21 victory over the Seahawks. Needless to say, big plays such as
						interceptions and fumbles can shift the momentum in a game and are huge determinants to the
						success of a team.

					<p>
						In 2015, the Carolina Panthers led the league with a 15 - 1 record and won the NFC championships. Part of this success was driven by star all-pro cornerback Josh Norman and linebacker Luke Keuchly. The panthers were able to rack up a +26 turnover differential, with 24 picks verse 11 interceptions thrown and 28 fumble recoveries verse 15 lost. The Panthers dominated the NFL with their ability to take the ball away, and ultimately helped them land a spot in the Superbowl.

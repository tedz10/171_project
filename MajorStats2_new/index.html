				<p>With 32 teams in the NFL and only 12 playoff spots, each team sets out every season with the goal of winning games and making the playoffs.
					In this project, we seek to uncover and explore which features should coaches focus on to build a playoff caliber team</p>

						</blockquote>
					</aside>
					<p>The NFL has emerged into a pass-heavy game, much more so than the history of the league has ever seen.
						While passing records continue to fall with the incorporation of faster, spread offense, perhaps the run game is getting overlooked as the true key to success.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Seattle Seahawks are a prime example of this. The 2014 Seahawks burst into the playoff scene on the back of Pro Bowl running back Marshawn Lynch’s 1306 rush yards and star quarterback Russell Wilson’s ability to scramble for nearly 900 yards.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite pundits and players’ declarations that year that the NFL “is a passing league now”, the Seahawks’ rushing power led them all the way to a second consecutive Super Bowl appearance that year.
